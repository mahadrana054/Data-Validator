# DATA VALIDATOR
Simple, CLI-based data cleaning and validation tool — for CSV, JSON and Excel files.
Data Validator loads a file into a pandas DataFrame, runs quick automatic checks (required columns, dtype mismatches, duplicates, missing values) and provides a set of cleaning actions (fill missing values, unify date formats, remove duplicates, standardize columns, detect outliers). This README explains the project, how to run it, and — as requested — breaks the main script into logical code blocks and explains each block in plain English
